# Reporting an issue or a feature request

Issues and feature requests are tracked in the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/KunstmaanSearchBundle/issues).

When reporting a bug, it may be a good idea to reproduce it in a basic project built using the Symfony Standard Edition
to allow developers of the bundle to reproduce the issue by simply cloning it and following some steps.
